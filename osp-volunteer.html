                <h3>Hosts</h3>
                <p>The Overnight Stay Program (OSP) is a two day, one night program (Sunday afternoon to Monday afternoon) that allows admitted high school seniors to experience life as a Cal student. The 2015 Overnight Stay Program will take place on two separate weekends:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Session I:</li>
                    <li>Session II:</li>
                </ul>
                <p>As a host, you will be playing an integral role in our program. High school participants will experience what their first years in the dorms will be like by staying with current Cal student hosts in UC Berkeley dorms on the Sunday night of their OSP session.</p>
                <h4>How can I sign up?</h4>
              <p>
                    <a class="btn btn-default btn-lg" href="#">Sign up to Host! &raquo;</a>
                </p>
                <h4>Who Can Host?</h4>
                <p>If you currently live in University-sponsored housing (ex: Unit 1, 2, 3, Foothill, Bowles, Stern, Clark Kerr, or Martinez Commons), you can sign up to be a host. Unfortunately, if you live in an off-campus apartment, private residence, or a fraternity/sorority, you cannot sign up to host an incoming student. However, even if you are unable to host, anyone is welcome to volunteer with OSP!</p>
                <h4>Responsibilities of a Host</h4>
                <p>Your main responsibility will be to pick up your assigned student(s) on Sunday night from Alumni House, provide the floor space in your dorm room for the student(s) for one night, and escort them back to Alumni House on Monday morning. Detailed instructions will be sent to you closer to the event once youâ€™ve signed up. CASA will take care of providing all meals and organize activities for them throughout the day.</p>
                <h3>Volunteers</h3>
                <p>OSP is the flagship program of the Cal Alumni Student Association (CASA) which allows high school students to experience life as a Cal student. What these incoming students want more than anything is to talk to current Cal students (you!) about why they should come here and why you specifically chose Cal.</p>
                <h4>Why Volunteer?</h4>
                <p>By volunteering, you become an integral part of this experience. You can interact personally with participants by leading dorm tours, conducting classroom visits, hosting a participant, or even helping with more functional tasks. Either way, you are providing participants with a chance to experience Cal and are helping them make one of the most important decisions of their lives. There are a variety of different shifts available for both sessions spanning from midday Sunday to Monday afternoon. Any and all Cal students can volunteer!</p>
                <h4>How can I sign up?</h4>
                <p>Follow the link below to choose which volunteer shifts you would like to sign up for. We encourage you to volunteer for as many shifts and OSP sessions as possible! The descriptions of all the shifts are listed below.</p>
